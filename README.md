#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

   click on installation
   Select Prefferend Language , windows, 64 bit operating system
   shutdown
   Select USB drive,
   shutdown
   Turnon the computer, a splash screen will pop up the key to press
   Drag the USB all the way to the top
   save and exit

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
   
   Go to the browser click on download vcode
   choose device and download
   Click on Download to install

3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com
Download Git for Windows:

On the homepage, click on the "Download" button. This will automatically start the download of the Git for Windows installer.
Run the Installer:

Once the download is complete, locate the downloaded file (usually in your "Downloads" folder) and double-click on the Git-<version>-<bit>.exe file to run the installer.
Start the Installation Process:

A User Account Control (UAC) prompt may appear, asking for permission to allow the installer to make changes to your device. Click "Yes" to proceed.
Select Components:

In the setup window, you can select the components you want to install. By default, the necessary components are pre-selected. Click "Next" to continue.
Choose the Default Editor Used by Git:

Select your preferred text editor to be used by Git (e.g., Vim, Notepad++, Visual Studio Code). Click "Next" to proceed.
Adjust Your PATH Environment:

Choose "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software" to ensure that Git and Git Bash are accessible from the command line. Click "Next" to continue.
Select HTTPS Transport Backend:

Select the default option "Use the OpenSSL library" and click "Next".
Configure the Line Ending Conversions:

Choose the option "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings" and click "Next".
Choose the Terminal Emulator:

Select "Use MinTTY (the default terminal of MSYS2)" for Git Bash. Click "Next" to continue.
Choose the Default Behavior of Git Pull:

Select the default option and click "Next".
Choose a Credential Helper:

Choose "Git Credential Manager Core" and click "Next".
Select Additional Options:

Leave the default options selected (e.g., Enable file system caching) and click "Install".
Complete the Installation

Open Git bash
Navigate to project Directory
initialize the Git repository
Add Files to your repository
Commit your changes

Login to Github
create a Repository on Github
connect to a remote repository on Github
Push your changes to github

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

  Select the python version to download
  Click on intsall Now
  Double-click the executable file, which is downloaded,
  Select Customize installation and proceed
  Click on the Add Path check box, it will set the python automatically


5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).
   Download get-pip.py
   run python get-pip.py.
   Verify pip installation using pip --version.
   Use pip to install Python packages as needed.
   To install packages on pip: python -m pip install Django

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

   Go to brower to download a version of mysql that is supported by windows
   Click on server only for your custom setup
   configure Mysql server on windows
   Authentication method
   Account and roles
   Windows service
   Logging options
   Advanced option
   Apply configuration

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

   Install VirtualBox from the official VirtualBox website.
   Download an ISO file of the desired operating system.
   Create a new virtual machine in VirtualBox.
   Configure the virtual machine settings and attach the ISO file.
   Start the virtual machine and install the operating system.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process.
